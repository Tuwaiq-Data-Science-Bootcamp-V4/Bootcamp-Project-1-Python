# CVSS Calculator 
## What is CVSS ?
***Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)*** is an industry standard for assessing the severity of security vulnerabilities. 
It provides a technique for scoring each vulnerability on a variety of measures.

### CVSS Scores :
- exploitability score
- impact score
- impact function
  
### Measures :

| **Access Vector** | **Access Complexity** | **Authentication** | **Confidentiality** | **Integrity** | **Availability** |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| How an attacker can gain access to the target system |  The level of complexity required to exploit a vulnerability | The level of access required for an attacker to exploit a vulnerability | The potential impact of a vulnerability on the confidentiality of information  | The impact that a vulnerability can have on the integrity of a system or data | The impact of a vulnerability on the availability of the affected system |

## What is the CVSS Calculator ? 
***CVSS Calculator*** is an online tool that scoring each vulnerability on a variety of measures. The analyst should be able to do the following tasks : 


- Display the meaning of each metric.
- Choose the metrics of the vulnerability that he wants to evaluate.
- Calculate the CVSS, exploitability score, impact score, and impact function.
- Show the severity of security vulnerability.
