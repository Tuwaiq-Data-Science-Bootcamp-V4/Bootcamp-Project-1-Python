## Overview
This is a simple personal finance manager program that allows you to track your monthly savings progress towards a specified savings goal. It also allows you to view your savings history and total savings amount.

## How to Use
1. Run the program.
2. Enter your monthly salary and savings goal.
3. Choose from the following options:
   - 1. Add Monthly Savings: Enter your monthly savings amount to update your total savings.
   - 2. View Savings Progress: See the percentage of your savings goal achieved.
   - 3. View Savings History: View the history of your monthly savings.
   - 4. View Total Savings: View the total savings amount.
   - 5. Exit: Quit the program.

## Code Explanation
- The program starts by asking for your monthly salary and savings goal, which are stored in a dictionary.
- It uses a while loop to repeatedly display the available options and take user input until the user chooses to exit.
- The program uses functions to calculate the savings progress and total savings.
- The user's savings history is stored in a list, and it is updated with each new monthly savings amount entered by the user.
- The program uses a simple percentage calculation to determine the progress towards the savings goal.
- The program uses a `break` statement to exit the loop when the user chooses to exit.
